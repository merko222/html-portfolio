<h1>The Best Anime According To Meher</h1>
<h2> My top three anime of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Yona Of The Dawn</h3>

<p>This is one of the best anime I've watched. The plot, charcters, design, all of it is amazing. 
    It would be my comfort anime if I didn't need comforting after watching it </p>
<h3>Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood</h3>
<img src="../assets/images/fmab.jfif" />
<p>A very good vs evil kinda thing goes on here, except we don't know the evil here.
    All in all, the pacing and plot is pretty well thought out, so its a must recommend.

<h3>Yuri ON Ice!!!</h3>

<p>Now THIS is a comfort anime. The main character finds a way out of his problems and 
    finds family and love on the way. The only villain here is MAPPA for cancelling Ice Adolesence.</p>
